# KSU GPA
very simple and light gpa calculator for King Saud University students,
(usablitiy was the main concern).


## Try it 
https://wadhahessam.github.io/ksu-gpa/


## Motivation 
since there is no official GPA calculator for King Saud University and other 
GPA calculators in the internet have so many problems like : 
- requiring user to search for his old points and hours and gpa.
- hard to use.
- takes many steps and buttons to get the final result.
- require scrolling up and down.
- not responsive for all devices.
- has more size than it really needs.


there came the need for an application that addresses all the above problems.
